Blocking Socket Client-Server Example
This project demonstrates how to implement a client-server model using blocking sockets, where two clients connect to a server. The server waits for connections, and once connected, clients can send and receive messages in a blocking manner.

Limitations:
Since the server uses blocking sockets, it waits for one client to send data before handling another.
